# XML and JSON to HTML Converter

## Project Description
This project provides a modular Python application that converts XML and JSON files into HTML format. The tool is divided into two packages:

1. **xmltohtml**: Handles XML to HTML conversion.
2. **jsontohtml**: Handles JSON to HTML conversion.

The application is structured for clarity, scalability, and ease of use, making it ideal for educational purposes, prototyping, or real-world use cases involving data visualization.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Design
- Define the classes for converting XML and JSON to HTML.
- Establish proper error handling and modularity.

### Phase 2: Package Creation
- Split functionality into the `xmltohtml` and `jsontohtml` packages.

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- Test the application with sample XML and JSON files.
- Validate the output HTML structure.

### Phase 4: Deployment
- Prepare the repository for GitHub with appropriate documentation.

## Steps to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/xml-json-to-html-converter.git
cd xml-json-to-html-converter
```

### 2. Set Up the Project Structure
Ensure the following folder structure is in place:
```
xml-json-to-html-converter/
├── xmltohtml/
│   └── converter.py
├── jsontohtml/
│   └── converter.py
├── html_converter/
    ├── main.py
    ├── example.xml
    ├── example.json
```

### 3. Run the Application

#### For XML to HTML Conversion:
1. Place your XML file in the `html_converter/` folder.
2. Update the `example.xml` file name in `main.py` if necessary.
3. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python html_converter/main.py
   ```

#### For JSON to HTML Conversion:
1. Place your JSON file in the `html_converter/` folder.
2. Update the `example.json` file name in `main.py` if necessary.
3. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python html_converter/main.py
   ```

### 4. View the Output
- The converted HTML files (`output_from_xml.html` and `output_from_json.html`) will be saved in the `html_converter/` folder.
